# Value Stock Screener
A first-year project for the University of Michigan's Master of Applied Data Science program's Milestone I class.

This project seeks to deploy a data pipeline that independently, from start to finish, scrapes S&P 500 names, pulls fundamentals data through Quandl and pricing data from Yahoo!Finance, then, through a series of easily modifiable code, filters for value stocks and returns a dataframe of possible options with relevant investing metrics.
